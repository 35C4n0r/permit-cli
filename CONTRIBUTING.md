### <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/issues) or even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker; maybe an issue for your problem already exists, and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it.
In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a full loom or other kind of terminal recording, so we can understand the issue and reproduce it.

### <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Command / Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/issues) to our GitHub Repository.
Please provide as much detail and context as possible, along with examples or references to similar features, as this will help us understand your request better.

We encourage you to contribute to Permit CLI by submitting a [Pull Request](#submit-pr) with your feature implementation and are happy to guide you through the process.

We are always looking to improve Permit CLI and would love to hear your ideas!
